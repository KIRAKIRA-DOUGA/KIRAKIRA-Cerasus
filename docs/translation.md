# Translation

**Welcome to KIRAKIRAâ˜†DOUGA PROJECT TEAM TRANSLATION GROUP!**

If you are from Discord or other non-GitHub platform, please tell @Aira your GitHub ID, and she will invite you to our GitHub organization and let you join the *Translation* group.

We have a branch named `locale`. Once you have joined the team, you can push commits to this branch directly.

Remember to check file updates frequently. We may add new or modify existing strings that needs to be translated.

The new and modified strings will be marked with
```typescript
// NEW
```
at the end of each strings. You should remove this mark after you have confirmed that this string is okay.

### For Non-developers

We strongly recommend you to use **Visual Studio Code** to edit the files, just like other developers. If you are new in Git, you could try to use **GitHub Desktop**. And remember to select the correct branch, you can't directly commit to `develop` and `deployment` branches.

### Tips

Our designers are from China, the UI was designed in Chinese. So if you could speak Chinese, please consider translating from Chinese directly first.

### Need Helps?

You could contact our developers directly in `Translation / general` in our Discord server. But please do not **@** them too often unless it's very important.

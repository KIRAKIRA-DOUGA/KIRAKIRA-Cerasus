# Translation

**Welcome to KIRAKIRA☆TRANSLATION TEAM!**

If you are from Discord or another non-GitHub platform, tell Aira your GitHub ID, and she will invite you to our GitHub organization and let you join the *Translation* team.

We will create a branch for each language called `locale-<语言名>` (e.g. `locale-Japanese`). Once you join the team, you can push commits to these branches directly.

Remember to check file updates frequently. We may add or modify content that needs to be translated.

New and modified content will be marked with `// NEW`. You should remove the mark after you can confirm this string is ok.

### For non-developers

We recommend you use **Visual Studio Code** to edit files, just like our developers. If you are new to git, you can try to use **GitHub Desktop**. Remember to select the correct branch, you can't commit directly to `main`.

### Tips

Our designers are from China, the UI was designed in Chinese. So if you speak Chinese, please consider translating from Chinese first.

### Need help?

You can contact our developers directly in `Translation / general` in our Discord server. But don't @ them too often unless it's very important.
